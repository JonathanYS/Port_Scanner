# Port_Scanner
 This is a simple port scanner, created for learning purposes. It is illegal to scan ports without permission.
 
This project is using Python 3.11. It also uses scapy as mentioned in the requirements file.
 
The execution of this program is pretty much self-explanatory as well as the comments in the code segment.
 All you need to do is enter a legitimate IP address to scan its ports and a range of ports to scan.
